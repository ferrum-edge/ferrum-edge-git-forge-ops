# Shared Ferrum contracts

GitForgeOps pins the shared Ferrum contracts release in
[`contracts/ferrum-contracts/PIN`](../contracts/ferrum-contracts/PIN). The vendored plugin
catalog, `provisioned-by` vocabulary, GitForgeOps resource-envelope fixtures, and the
GitForgeOps-owned resource schema are byte-for-byte copies from `contracts-edge-0.9.9`. The
contract test verifies every file's SHA-256, checks that the pinned Edge version maps to the
contracts tag and appears in the validator checksum allowlist, compares plugin names and
priorities plus retired and reserved names with the local catalog, checks the assembler's
`provisioned-by` label, parses valid and invalid resource fixtures with the local `Resource` serde
type, and checks the schema's top-level envelope against that type.

The plugin catalog also describes config schemas and per-plugin scope constraints. This repository
does not duplicate those values in its local catalog, so the conformance test compares the catalog
fields GitForgeOps does carry: built-in names, priorities, retired names, and reserved names.

## Bumping the pin

1. Choose the new immutable `contracts-edge-*` tag. Read its commit SHA from
   `gh api repos/ferrum-edge/ferrum-contracts/git/ref/tags/<tag>` and dereference the object
   if the tag points to an annotated tag.
2. Download the adopted vocabulary, GitForgeOps resource schema and fixtures from that tag into
   the matching paths under `contracts/ferrum-contracts/`.
3. Update `PIN` with the tag, commit SHA, and `shasum -a 256` for every vendored file.
4. Update `edge_version` in `PIN` and the explicit compatible-version mapping in the contract
   test when the qualified Ferrum Edge version changes.
5. Resolve drift through the owning implementation or the upstream contract, then re-vendor; do
   not patch a shared vendored file locally.
6. Open a PR and let the existing Rust CI run the contract test.
